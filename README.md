# [Latitude and Weather](https://scottgall.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/)
This repo contains files for a static site that presents data and visualizations to show how latitude effects the following weather factors:
* Max Temperature
* Humidity
* Cloudiness
* Wind Speed

The site is hosted on GitHub Pages [here](https://scottgall.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/).

Bootstrap 5 was used to create the UI.
